<p><img src="image.jpg" width="100" height="100"> The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, but a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - If overflow is clipped, a scrollbar should be added to see the rest of the content
Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

Note: In OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only shown when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).
